# Amphora Data Samples

This repository contains sample projects to help you get started on the Amphora Data platform. Many of these samples are actually run every day by our team.

## WeatherZone ETL (python)

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/amphoradata/Public/_apis/build/status/WeatherZone_ETL?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/amphoradata/Public/_build/latest?definitionId=6&branchName=master)

ETL, or Extract-Transform-Load, is a pattern for moving data. In the [python-WeatherZone](python-WeatherZone/README.md) sample, you can see how you can connect two API's together by extracting data from the WeatherZone API and loading them into several Amphorae.

## National Electricity Market (C#)

In the [dotnet-NEM](dotnet-NEM/README.md) sample, we show how to use C# and the dotnet Amphora Data SDK to pull data from a public API and load it into Amphorae.
